This may be partly attributed to the emergence of open source projects where participants never meet each other and increasingly popular commercial globally distributed projects where groups of developers are often separated by many time zones. Version control and problem tracking tools are a basic necessity in such communication-poor environments. However, their value is getting more and more recognized in small co-located projects because information stored in these tools represent most of the project's decision making history.},
